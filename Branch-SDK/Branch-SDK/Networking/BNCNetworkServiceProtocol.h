/**
    The `BNCNetworkServiceProtocol` and `BNCNetworkOperationProtocol` define protocols for 
    a drop in replacement for the standard Branch SDK networking.

    To use your own networking class, it must conforms to these network protocols. Set your
    networking class at run time by calling:
        
        `BranchSetNetworkServiceClass(Class networkServiceClass)`

    with your class as a parameter before any other Branch methods are called.
